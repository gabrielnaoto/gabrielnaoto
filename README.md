# hello world  🌎

### 🙋‍♂️ who am I?

I'm a software engineer, mainly focused in frontend development, but I enjoy learning and discovering new things.
Currently working at [Jungsoft](https://jungsoft.io/) and [kartrak](https://www.kartrak.app/) where I develop new things with technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Elixir, React JS and React Native and Java. 

### ⌨ why do I code?

Because I enjoy creating apps and things people will like to use. 

And I think I need to keep coding to keep learning.

### 🗂 what you'll find over here

Here I enjoy publishing some of my latest experiments and side projects I'm working on.
